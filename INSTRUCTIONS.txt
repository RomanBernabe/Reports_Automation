## This script only works if the computer has Excel installed on it ## 

How to run the script:

From Odoo, download the spreadsheet files in this order:

1.- All the Open tickets 
2.- All the Open AND Breached tickets
3.- All the opened tickets on the last 24-72 hours.

*PLEASE MAKE SURE THE DOWNLOADED EXCEL FILES ARE NOT CORRUPTED.

** REMEMBER, if Odoo says 1-50/200 tickets on the filter bar, you have to change it to 1-200/200
to download everything. **

Strictly download the spreadsheets in that order. The script won't work otherwise. 

-- Once those three files have been downloaded, copy and paste them on this folder. 
---- Move the Summary Backup jobs csv file to this folder too.
------Then, double click on the 'do_report' file. That's it. Ace that meeting.
